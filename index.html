        <h1>What is Zephyr?</h1>
        <p>Zephyr was written with one goal in mind; to separate the process of ETL from the workings of your BigData platform.
        Whether you have streams of data coming in constantly or batches delivered periodically, the Extraction and Transform portions
        of your data management needs remain the same.
        </p>
        <p>Zephyr is here to abstract your ETL process in the right way.  For many users, you're ready to run out of the box.
        For those of you with special needs - extend away.  Zephyr is both extensible and configurable by design, and Open Source
        (APLv2) if you need even more flexibility.</p>
